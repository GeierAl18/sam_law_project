			<h1>Our Latest Reviews</h1>

			<h3>Overview (PC)</h3>
			<p>Overview is an online multiplayer first-person-shooter created by Froststorm, released on May 24, 2016. There are over 100,000 classes to play as, all of them sporting their own special abilities to take out the enemy team's opposing forces. Each and every character that we've played so far has been extremely fun to play, however we have only played the first 10. Our test monkeys in Game Space Laboratories will continue to research the viability of each character in the game over the coming years.</p>
			<p>In Overview, you are matched up with other players in a team of 6 to take out the opposing team of 6 by either capturing their objectives or preventing the enemy from doing the same to you. Everyone on your team is generally worse than you, while the opposing team lineup is filled with gods who have mastered this game long since before you were born. The matchmaking service is arguably the worst part of the game, but it works sometimes so I can't really complain.</p>
			<p>Every character has multiple abilities to help them in the fight, including an ultimate ability that unleashes each character's strongest potential.
			<h4>Overall Score 10/10: This is the culmination of humanity's efforts to create the perfect video game. Download it right now, or else...</h4>

			<h3>The Legend of Link (Switch)</h3>
			<p>Game Space is nothing without our employees. We only hire the best of the best. Employees go through a rigorous training process in order to truly understand the meaning of hardcore gaming, and how we can share that knowledge with our loyal customers. We realize that our customers are hardcore gamers, just like us, so we give them equally hardcore service.</p>
